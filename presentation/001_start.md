# Aaaaaaaaaargh

Why can't it be simple
## Like in 
## open source projects...
@css/yellow.css

But you continue

- Registering services
- Request access to repos
- Configuring services
- Start coding
- Creating custom scripts
- Setup deployment 
- .....

After a year
# You want to test the system
and want to deploy to an environment

This takes a lot of effort..

And 
# you realize you're 
slow

very 

very very 

very very very slow

You think..
# Why can't we use the 
# best practices in the community..
@css/yellow.css

But you continue

Then you're working on 
# Digital Trust
and
# Blockchain

You can't build trust on
closed software

You think...
# We must 
# open source this...
@css/yellow.css

# Philips vision

To become the best 
# in software 
in the healthtech industry

# Let's do this!
@css/yellow.css

# What is so different?
@css/green.css

###### What is so different?
## Legal
@css/green.css

###### What is so different?
## IP generation
@css/green.css

###### What is so different?
## Developers
@css/green.css

###### What is so different?
## Organisation structures
## (my code)
@css/green.css

###### What is so different?
## Inner source
@css/green.css

# What needs to change?

## Culture change
@css/red.css

Developers grew up
# with open source
Their bosses mostly not
@css/red.css

A lot of developers finally 
# admitted they were 
already doing open source
@css/red.css

So we need to address
# the bosses
@css/red.css

#### How to change your company?

## Take them from other 
## open source projects.
@css/brown.css

#### How to change your company?
## Start with minimal variation 
## of licenses. MIT f.e.
@css/brown.css

#### How to change your company?
## Get contracts / business impact 
## analysis and privacy impact 
## analysis approved...  
### for all third party services.
@css/brown.css

#### How to change your company?

## From scratch.
@css/brown.css

## involved in spreading the message.
@css/brown.css

#### How to change your company?
## Make sure Open Source gets
## a landing page on the 
## corporate domain
@css/brown.css

###### Misconceptions
## Free maintenance
@css/green2.css

###### Misconceptions
## Now anyone can publish 
## anything under our 
## companies name.
@css/green2.css

###### Misconceptions
## Organization smells
### "Don’t open source yet, 
### maybe project x can still
### use it”. 
### Wait until no-one needs it.
@css/green2.css

###### Misconceptions
## Organization smells
### "Don’t feed the competitors."
@css/green2.css

###### Misconceptions
## Organization smells
### "Use your own email account, 
### because otherwise you 
### will get in trouble"
@css/green2.css

# Good news
We did change some of the things.

@img/images/github-philips-software.png

#### Future 
## Do your collaborations open source. 
## For example for EU projects.
@css/brown.css

#### Future 
## Start contribution in existing
## open source projects in 
## name of your company
@css/brown.css

## Final Thought
#Pieter Hintjes:
"My only professional regret was to spend years 
of my life making *closed projects* for clients 
who inevitably threw my work away sooner or later."
