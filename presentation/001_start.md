# Aaaaaaaaaargh

Why can't it be simple
## Like in 
## open source projects...

But you continue

- Registering services
- Request access to repos
- Configuring services
- Start coding
- Creating custom scripts
- .....

After a year
# You want to test the system
and want to deploy to an environment

This takes a lot of effort..

And 
# you realize you're 
slow

very 

very very 

very very very slow

You think..
# Why can't we use the 
# best practices in the community..

But you continue

Then you're working on 
# Digital Trust
and
# Blockchain

You can't build trust on
closed software

You think...
# We must open source this...

# Philips vision

To become the best 
# in software 
in the healthtech industry

# Let's do this!
